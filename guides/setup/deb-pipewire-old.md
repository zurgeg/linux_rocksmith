# JACK to ASIO with pipewire on Debian-based distros

I don't have a debian-based machine to test this. Everything up to starting the game was tested in a VM.

# Install necessary stuff

(I recommend `wine-staging`, but usual `wine` works as well.)

[missing, sorry]

```
[missing, sorry]
# the groups should already exist, but just in case
sudo groupadd audio
sudo groupadd realtime
sudo usermod -aG audio $USER`
sudo usermod -aG realtime $USER`
```

Log out and back in.

	For the groups, run `groups`. This will give you a list, which should contain "audio" and "realtime".

# wineasio

Installing `base-devel` is very useful for using the AUR and compiling in general.

[Download](https://github.com/wineasio/wineasio/releases) the newest zip and unpack it. Open a terminal inside the newly created folder and run the following commands:

```
# build
rm -rf build32
rm -rf build64
make 32
make 64

# Install on normal wine
sudo cp build32/wineasio.dll /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/wineasio.dll
sudo cp build32/wineasio.dll.so /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/wineasio.dll.so
sudo cp build64/wineasio.dll /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine/wineasio.dll
sudo cp build64/wineasio.dll.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine/wineasio.dll.so
```

`wineasio` is now installed on your native wine installation.

	<summary>How to check if it's installed correctly</summary>

	find /usr/lib/ -name "wineasio.dll"
	find /usr/lib/ -name "wineasio.dll.so"
	find /usr/lib32/ -name "wineasio.dll"
	find /usr/lib32/ -name "wineasio.dll.so"

This should output 4 paths (ignore the errors).
</details>

To make Proton use wineasio, we need to copy these files into the appropriate locations:

```
# !!! WATCH OUT FOR VARIABLES !!!
cp /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/wineasio.dll.so "$PROTON/lib/wine/i386-unix/wineasio.dll.so"
cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine/wineasio.dll.so "$PROTON/lib64/wine/x86_64-unix/wineasio.dll.so"
```

In theory, this should also work with Lutris runners (located in `$HOME/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/`)

## Setting up the game's prefix/compatdata

1. Delete or rename `$STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/compatdata/221680`, then start Rocksmith and stop the game once it's running.
1. `WINEPREFIX=$STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/compatdata/221680/pfx regsvr32 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/wineasio.dll` (Errors are normal, should end with "regsvr32: Successfully registered DLL [...]")

I don't know a way to check if this is set up correctly. This is one of the first steps I'd redo when I have issues.

## Installing RS_ASIO

[Download](https://github.com/mdias/rs_asio/releases) the newest release, unpack everything to the root of your Rocksmith installation (`$STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/common/Rocksmith2014/`)

Edit RS_ASIO.ini: fill in `WineASIO` where it says `Driver=`. Do this for `[Asio.Output]` and `[Asio.Input.0]`. If you don't play multiplayer, you can comment out Input1 and Input2 by putting a `;` in front of the lines.

## Set up JACK

Open pavucontrol ("PulseAudio Volume Control"), go to "Configuration" and make sure there's exactly one input device and one output device enabled.

All available devices will automatically be tied to Rocksmith, and the game doesn't like you messing around in the patchbay (= it would crash).

## Starting the game

Delete the `Rocksmith.ini` inside your Rocksmith installation. It will auto-generate with the correct values. The only important part is the `LatencyBuffer=`, which has to match the Buffer Periods.

Steam needs to be running.

If we start the game from Steam, the game cant connect to wineasio (you won't have sound and will get an error message). So there's two ways around that:

### Command (No Lutris)

```
# cd is necessary for the Rocksmith.ini and the DLC folder
cd $STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/common/Rocksmith2014
PIPEWIRE_LATENCY=256/48000 WINEPREFIX=$STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/compatdata/221680/pfx $PROTON/bin/wine $STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/common/Rocksmith2014/Rocksmith2014.exe
```

`PIPEWIRE_LATENCY`: Rocksmith needs a sample rate of 48000. 256 refers to the buffer size. This number worked great for me, but you can experiment with others, of course.

(You don't always have to do this, but this give me the most reliable experience) As soon as you see the games window, take the focus away from it, eg. on a different window. Don't focus Rocksmith until the logos start to appear (it's usually the same amount of time). At this point, RS_ASIO is initialized and you can start playing.

### Yes Lutris

Using Proton outside of it's wrapper is discouraged, but if we use normal wine, the game can't find Steam, which is needed for Steam's DRM.

Open Lutris and add a game:

* General:
	* Name: Rocksmith® 2014 Edition - Remastered
	* Runner: Wine
	* Release year: 2014
* Game Options
	* Executable: $STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/common/Rocksmith 2014/Rocksmith2014.exe
	* Working directory: $STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/common/Rocksmith 2014/
	* Wine prefix: $STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/compatdata/221680/pfx
* Runner options
	* Wine version: Custom
	* (Toggle Advanced options to see this) Custom Wine executable: enter path to `dist/bin/wine` or `files/bin/wine` of your desired Proton version
* System options (only needed for pipewire)
	* Environment Variables: PIPEWIRE_LATENCY=256/48000

(People who don't use the Steam version can just choose whatever runner they like.)

Save this and hit "Play."
