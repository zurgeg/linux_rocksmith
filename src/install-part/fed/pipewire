**This guide will use the Steam package from "RPM Fusion nonfree". This is to avoid sandboxing being an issue for now.**

An alternative way to do this via Flatpak is described [here](https://github.com/theNizo/linux_rocksmith/issues/31) Please note that the maintainer (theNizo) has no experience with Flatpak.

I assume that `pipewire` and a session manager (eg. `wireplumber`, or `pipewire-media-session`) is already installed.

```
sudo dnf install -y gcc make glibc-devel.i686 wine wine-devel.i686 wine-devel.x86_64 pipewire-jack-audio-connection-kit-devel.i686 pipewire-jack-audio-connection-kit-devel.x86_64 pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulseaudio realtime-setup pavucontrol qpwgraph
