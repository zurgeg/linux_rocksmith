# Rocksmith 2014 on Linux

These are a few Guides to get [Rocksmith 2014](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221680/Rocksmith_2014_Edition__Remastered/) running on Linux. In case you haven't tried gaming on Linux yet, other than not working, it won't get harder than this by far for other games.

# Disclaimer

This is the bare minimum to get it to work. I don't know if certain changes recommended by other people have a performance impact.

I tested it on Manjaro, Arch and a Linux Mint VM. Due to the VM factor, I was actually able to start the game, but I got about 1fps, definitely not playable.

I have only tested the Steam version.

**I take no responsibility and will not guarantee for this working.**

# Prerequisites

Don't install or copy Rocksmith from/to an NTFS drive. It will not start. (I think that's because of permissions, but I'm not sure.) There's probably a way, but it's easier not having to bother with it.

If you use Proton-GE, install scripts sometimes don't run. In that case, use Valve's Proton for the first start, then switch to Proton-GE.

We will need wine, which is installed in the first step.

## Common paths

I will refer to them with variables. You can actually set them as variables via `variablename=value` and just copy-paste the commands, or replace the text. Keep in mind that these are temporary, so only available in the terminal instance where the variable was defined.

`#.##` will be a placeholder for the Proton version you use. So for "Proton #.##", an example replacement would be "Proton 7.0".

* `$HOME`: Already set, don't worry about it. (redirects to `/home/<username>`)
* `$STEAMLIBRARY`: The Steam Library, where Rocksmith is installed in. You can check it by opening Steam, then going to `Steam -> Settings -> Storage`. Above the disk usage indicator, there's a path. that's the one we need.
* `$PROTON`: A specific location inside your Proton installation
	* Normal Proton: `/path/to/steamapps/common/Proton\ #.##/dist`
	* Proton-GE: It's located in the default Steam Library under `compatibilitytools.d/Proton-#.##-GE-#/files`
	* Lutris Runners: No specific location, just `$HOME/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/wine-ge-8-25-x86_64`

# Guides

There are two ways to do this. The one most people on [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/app/221680) use is quicker, but results in high delay and distorted sound. It routes the sound through ALSA. This can be found in "Other Guides".

Then there's the way of routing the audio through JACK -> wineASIO -> RS_ASIO, which has less delay and sounds better, but also takes longer to set up. These can be found in the table below.

**Recent Proton versions:**

|| pipewire | non-pipewire |
|---|---|---|
| Arch | [Guide](guides/setup/arch-pipewire.md) | [Guide](guides/setup/arch-non-pipewire.md) |
| Debian | [Not finished](guides/setup/deb-pipewire.md) | [Guide](guides/setup/deb-non-pipewire.md) |
| Fedora | [Guide](guides/setup/fed-pipewire.md) | N/A |
| NixOS  | [Not finished](guides/setup/nix-pipewire.md) | N/A |
| Steam Deck | [Guide](guides/setup/deck-pipewire.md) | N/A |

## Scripts

Because someone asked, I have written scripts that do everything for you.

For native Steam: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theNizo/linux_rocksmith/main/scripts/native-steam.sh && ./native-steam.sh && rm native-steam.sh`

For other Rocksmith installations: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theNizo/linux_rocksmith/main/scripts/other.sh && ./other.sh && rm other.sh`
